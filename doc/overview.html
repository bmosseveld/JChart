  <p>
    The JChart Library can be used to visualize different types of charts in a Java application.
  </p>
  <p>
    It currently supports line charts, bar charts, pie charts and scatter charts.<br>
    These charts can be easily integrated in a Java application because they are extensions of JPanel.<br>
    <br>
    The main class is JChart with extensions:<br>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
      <li>JBarChart</li>
      <li>JLineChart</li>
      <li>JPieChart</li>
      <li>JScatterChart</li>
      <li>JBoxChart</li>
    </ul>
